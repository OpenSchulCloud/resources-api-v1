# Schemas

This folder contains all the JSON schemas used by the API.

- the [resource schema](resource) to validate resources
- the [search response schema](search-response) for responses of the search API
- the [license schema](license) to standardize a way of licensing
- the [curriculum schema](curriculum) to validate if content matches with a standardized teaching curriculum

Schemas can be [tested](test) using examples. You can develop the schema in a test-driven way.
